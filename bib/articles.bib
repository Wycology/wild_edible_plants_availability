abstract = {Wild-edible fruits tree (WEFT) species constitute an important source of nutrients but nowadays, these resources are concentrated in the protected areas. This study aimed to evaluate the diversity and distribution pattern of WEFT species in the Lama Forest Reserve in Benin, to provide basics for designing appropriate conservation strategies. An inventory of WEFT species was carried out in 53 square plots demarcated in the four vegetation types of the reserve. Shannon (H), Pielou (E), Green (GI) indices, and the actual distribution maps of the species were generated. The results revealed 10 WEFT species within the dense forests and young fallow having nine species, while the old fallow had seven species. The diversity indices showed that the reserve had low floristic diversity (H = 2.41 and E = 0.73) in WEFT species. Dialium guineense, Ficus capensis, Mimusops andongensis, and Pancovia bijuga, in the young fallow, Lecaniodiscus cupanioides, and Psidium guajava in the degraded dense forest and L. cupanioides, and P. bijuga in old fallow exhibited an aggregative distribution (GI ≥ 1), suggesting that more effort need to be put on their conservation in these vegetation types. The maps generated in this study can later be used as reference to carry out gap analyses.},

abstract = {Background: The Caatinga (dry land vegetation) is one of the most characteristic vegetation types in northeastern Brazil. It occupies a large percentage of the semi-arid region there, and generally supports two major types of economic activity: seasonal agriculture and the harvesting of plant products. However, very little information is available concerning the interaction of people with the plants of the Caatinga. Methods: A study was undertaken with the participation of 31 adults from a rural community in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil, in order to analyze the patterns of use of medicinal plant resources, and to test a number of hypotheses concerning their use and local knowledge about them. The sources of medicinal plants used by the local community, the differences in oral information concerning the use of plants with their effective uses, and the role of exotic plants in local folk medicine practices were examined. Results: Forty-eight plant species were cited as having medicinal uses, of which 56.25% are native to the Caatinga region. The patterns of harvesting and the importance of these trees and shrubs as medicinal plants seem to be compatible with a hypothesis based on the seasonal availability of plant resources. There is no direct correlation between known medicinal plants and those used by the local population, which agrees with observations made in different tropical regions. However, this observation was not interpreted in terms of the idea of "erosion" of knowledge (commonly used to explain this lack of correlation), but rather to propose two new concepts: "mass knowledge" and "stock knowledge". Conclusion: Native plants are a very significant component of locally used medicinal plants, although exotic plants are important for treating specific health problems - which leads the proposal of a hypothesis of diversification. {\textcopyright} 2006 de Albuquerque; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Ethnobotany has evolved from a discipline that largely documented the diversity of plant use by local people to one focused on understanding how and why people select plants for a wide range of uses. This progress has been in response to a repeated call for theory-inspired and hypothesis-driven research to improve the rigor of the discipline. Despite improvements, recent ethnobotanical research has overemphasized the use of quantitative ethnobotany indices and statistical methods borrowed from ecology, yet underemphasized the development and integration of a strong theoretical foundation. To advance the field of ethnobotany as a hypothesis-driven, theoretically inspired discipline, it is important to first synthesize the existing theoretical lines of research. We review and discuss 17 major theories and hypotheses in ethnobotany that can be used as a starting point for developing research questions that advance our understanding of people–plant interactions. For each theory or major hypothesis, we identify its primary predictions and testable hypotheses and then discuss how these predictions have been tested. Developing research to test these predictions will make significant contributions to the field of ethnobotany and create the critical mass of primary literature necessary to develop meta-analyses and to advance new theories in ethnobotany.},

abstract = {The much-publicized quest for miracle drug plants in tropical rainforests has provided compelling support for the preservationist agenda. This article questions the assumptions that underpin this claim, particularly the myth that pristine forest represents the primary repository of nature's medicinal providence. After tracing colonial European efforts at medicinal plant discovery, intellectual property exploitation, and plant transference and acclimation, I review the recent resurgence of scientific interest in tropical folk pharmacopoeias. In spite of the image marketed by environmental entrepreneurs, the medicinal foraging preference of rural tropical groups is largely successional mosaics of their own creation - trails, kitchen gardens, swiddens, and forest fallows. Focusing on the subsistence transition from hunting and gathering to small-scale cultivation, I propose that disturbance pharmacopoeias are the logical outcome of changing subsistence strategies, ecological processes, and disease patterns. Salient, familiar, accessible, and rich in bioactive compounds, anthropogenic nature represents the ideal tropical medicine chest. Whereas bioprospecting enterprises carried out during the colonial period and at present employ similar rhetoric - deadly disease, miracle cures, and fantastic profits - these endeavors were in the past and continue to be buttressed by fictitious notions of virgin tropical nature and the mysterious healing powers of its "primitives". {\textcopyright} 2004 by Association of American Geographers.},
